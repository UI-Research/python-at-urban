## State Zip Code Data

```{r}
# script to clean zip/state csv file for
# use in web scraping 
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidylog)

# read in data
zip_data <- read_csv("data/zip-state.csv") %>% 
	# filter out zctas
	filter(str_detect(zipcode, "^[0-9]+$"),
				 !is.na(city)) %>% 
	# get one zip code per county
	distinct(state, county, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
	mutate(state_abbr = str_to_lower(state_abbr)) %>% 
	# select just state abbreviation and zip codes
	select(state_abbr, county, zipcode)

# limit to small sample for workshop 
zip_data_small <- zip_data %>% 
	sample_n(10)

write_csv(zip_data_small, "data/zip_data_small.csv")
```

## Nested Dictionary

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Read in csv of states, counties, and zip codes (one zip per county)
 # Assuming you have a CSV file with columns 'State' and 'ZIP Code'
csv_file_path = 'data/zip_data_small.csv'

# read in csv
raw_csv = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path, dtype={'zipcode': str})

# Create a nested dictionary
state_counties_zipcodes = {}

for index, row in raw_csv.iterrows():
    state = row['state_abbr']
    county = row['county']
    zipcode = row['zipcode']

    if state not in state_counties_zipcodes:
        state_counties_zipcodes[state] = {}

    state_counties_zipcodes[state][county] = zipcode

```
