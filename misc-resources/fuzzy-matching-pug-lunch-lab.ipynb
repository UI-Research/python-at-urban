    "You can generally think of a similarity score as the number of edits that need to be made to one string of text in order to convert it to the other string of text. What an algorithm considers to be an \"edit\" varies, but generally is some combination of insertions, deletions, substitutions, or transpositions of characters. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***b***ed to ***r***ed requires 1 substitution\n",
    "- HAHA to HAHA***HA*** requires 2 insertions\n",
    "- happ***ily*** to happy requires 2 deletions\n",
    "- b***la***de to b***al***ed requires 1 transposition\n",
    "\n",
    "A few common algorithms include:\n",
    "- The Jaro-Winkler similarity score, which considers only transpositions\n",
    "- Levenshtein distance, which considers insertions, deletions, or substitutions\n",
    "- Hamming distance, which considers only substitutions\n",
    "- Damerau-Levenshtein distance, which includes all four of these kinds of edits\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity score will be a function not just of the edits, but also of the number of common characters. \"far\" to \"bar\" and \"revenue\" to \"revenge\" both require only one edit, but the latter two words would rightfully receive a higher fuzzy matching score because a larger proportion of the word is identical.\n",
