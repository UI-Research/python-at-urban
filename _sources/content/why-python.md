# Why Python 

Python is an open-source general-purpose programming language with broad versatility, clean and readable syntax, and an active developer community. Python’s simple and easy-to-understand syntax makes the learning curve much less steep compared to many other statistical software packages and programming languages. 

Over the past decade, Python has made great strides in its data analysis capabilities with machine learning packages like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), data visualizations tools like [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), text analysis packages like [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), web scraping libraries like [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), and interfaces for working with big data and cloud technology like [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) and [boto3](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/). 

Packages such as [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) and [rpy2](https://rpy2.github.io/) have also made using Python alongside R much easier, allowing users to benefit from the comparative advantages of the two languages together. 

Python’s multiple IDE options, like Spyder, PyCharm, or Juypter Notebook, also give users flexibility in how they develop and share their work with others.
