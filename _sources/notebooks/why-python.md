# Why Python 

Python is an open-source general purpose programming language with built-in functions, clean and readable syntax, and an active community developing products to improve Python’s abilities. Python’s simple and easy-to-understand syntax makes the learning curve much less steep compared to many other statistical software packages and programming languages. 

Python has made great strides in its data analysis capabilities in the past decade with new machine learning packages like SciKit-learn, data visualizations tools like Seaborn and Plotly, and text analysis packages like NTLK or Gensim. 

Python’s multiple IDE options, like Spyder, PyCharm, or Juypter Notebook, also give users flexibility in how they share their work with others.
